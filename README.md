# About Me

### Hi there! I'm Darryl

I'm a trained genetecist / molecular biologist with experience in academic research and more recently in science education. I'm learning Python and other tools to pivot into data science, where I hope to find myself back in a position where I can lose myself in data and find interesting stories to tell.

#### 2024 Goals

- Complete a data science skills bootcamp
- Secure my first position in tech

#### How to reach me

- email: darryl.c.john@gmail.com

#### Fun fact about _shibire_

_shibire_ is not just my GitHub username: it is a cool mutation in _Drosophila melanogaster_. _Drosophila_ are the tiny flies you sometimes find loitering around fruit bows. They're an important organism in genetics and they're the organism I'm most specialised in using. When flies have the _shibire_ mutation, they behave normally in temperatures up to 29ÂºC, but above 29ÂºC they become paralysed! What's especially cool is that this paralysis is reversible: lowering the temperature below 29ÂºC will result in the flies behaving normally again!
